# Prune Demo

This folder contains scripts and data for pruning the MTP and optimizing parameters.

## Files

- `ni20.py`: Python script for pruning.
- `run.sh`: Bash script to run the python script.
- `data/20.almtp`: Base MTP file for pruning.
- `data/xtwx.bin`, `data/xtwy.bin`: Extracted matrix/vector files.
- `optimization_results/pareto_objectives.csv`: Pareto objectives from optimization. (Output)
- `optimization_results/pareto_population.csv`: Pareto population from optimization. (Output)
- `optimization_results/pruned_mtp.almtp`: Pruned MTP potential file. (Output)

## Instructions

1. Run the pruning script:
   ```sh
   sh run.sh
   ```
2. Results are saved in `optimization_results/`.

## Details

- `ni20.py` uses the extracted matrices to prune the MTP and optimize parameters.
- Output files show the results of the optimization and pruning.
