# Extract Demo

This folder contains scripts and files for extracting problem matrices from the original MTP.

## Files

- `extract.sh`: Bash script to extract matrices and calculate loss.
- `ni20.almtp`: Original MTP potential file.
- `sample_output.txt`: Example console output from extraction.
- `train.cfg`: Training configuration file.

## Instructions

1. Run the extraction script:
   ```sh
   sh run.sh
   ```
2. This will generate matrix files, $\mathbf{y}^\intercal\mathbf{Wy}$, and neighbor count for pruning
3. In production, you would use these for the optimization. In this demo, this data has already been prepared in the next step.

## Details

- `extract.sh` reads `ni20.almtp` and `train.cfg`, performs extraction, and outputs results to `out/`.
