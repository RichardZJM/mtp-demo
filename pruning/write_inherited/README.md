# Write Inherited Demo

This folder contains scripts for writing a new pruned/inherited MTP using a mask.

## Files

- `inherited.py`: Python script to write inherited/pruned MTP.
- `mask.csv`: Mask file for selecting parameters. Chosen from the Pareto population.
- `pruned.almtp`: Example pruned MTP file. (Output)
- `run.sh`: Bash script to run the writing process.

## Instructions

1. Run the writing script:
   ```sh
   sh run.sh
   ```
2. The output is a new pruned MTP file.

## Details

- `inherited.py` reads `mask.csv` and uses it to select parameters from the original MTP.
- The script generates a new potential file based on the mask.
