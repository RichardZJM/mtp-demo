# MLIP-3 Active Learning Demo

## Purpose

This demo shows how to run a LAMMPS simulation with MLIP-3 active learning enabled. It demonstrates how the potential can automatically identify and save extrapolative atomic configurations for further training, improving the accuracy of the model.

## Files

- `in.lmp`: LAMMPS input script that sets up the simulation, loads the MLIP-3 potential, and enables active learning.
- `run.sh`: Bash script to execute the simulation using MPI.
- `preselected.cfg`: Output file containing atomic configurations identified as extrapolative by MLIP-3.
- `log.lammps`: Output log file generated by LAMMPS after running the simulation.

## Instructions

1. **Review the input script**  
   Open `in.lmp` to see how active learning is enabled using the `extrapolation_control` options.

2. **Run the simulation**  
   Execute the following command in the terminal:
   ```sh
   sh run.sh
   ```
3. Check results
   After the run, inspect `preselected.cfg` for configurations that MLIP-3 flagged as extrapolative. Note the simulation rate from `log.lammps`.

## Extrapolation Control Parameters

- `extrapolation_control:threshold_break=10`:
  If the extrapolation grade of any configuration exceeds 10, the simulation will stop immediately.
- `extrapolation_control:threshold_save=0.5`:
  Configurations with an extrapolation grade above 0.5 are saved to preselected.cfg.

Note: The value 0.5 is used here to force the selection and generate more examples for demonstration. In practical applications, a value of 2 is more typical and recommended for real active learning workflows.
