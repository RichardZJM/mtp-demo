# MLIP-3 Training Demo

This demo shows how to train and evaluate Moment Tensor Potentials (MTPs) using the MLIP-3 package.

## Purpose

- **Demonstrate MLIP-3 Workflow:** Shows the basic steps to train an MTP using example files and commands.
- **Explain File Usage:** Describes the roles of configuration and potential files.
- **Provide Example Commands:** Includes shell commands for training and error checking.

## Files

- `run.sh`: Bash script with example MLIP-3 commands for training and evaluation.
- `train.cfg`: Configuration file containing atomic structures and reference data.
- `10.almtp`: Example of an untrained potential file.
- `done.almtp`: Example of a trained potential file (generated after training).

## Instructions

1. **Review Files:** Read comments in `run.sh`.
2. **Run Training:** Execute the script with:
   ```sh
   sh run.sh
   ```

This demo is a starting point for learning MLIP-3 workflows and file formats.
