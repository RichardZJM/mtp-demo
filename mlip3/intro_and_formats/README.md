# MLIP-3 Intro and Formats Demo

This folder demonstrates the basic usage and file formats of the MLIP-3 package.

## Purpose

The demo is designed for beginners to:

- Explore the configuration file format (`sample.cfg`)
- Understand the difference between untrained (`untrained_potential.almtp`) and trained (`trained_potential.almtp`) potential files
- Learn basic MLIP-3 commands using the provided `run.sh` script

## Files

- `run.sh`: Example script showing how to use MLIP-3 help and list commands.
- `sample.cfg`: Example configuration file with comments explaining its format.
- `untrained_potential.almtp`: Example of an untrained potential file.
- `trained_potential.almtp`: Example of a trained potential file (do not edit manually).

## Instructions

1. Review the comments in each file for explanations.
2. Run `sh run.sh` to see MLIP-3 help and command usage.
3. Use `Ctrl+F` to search for comments (`#`) if needed.

**Note:** Never modify a trained potential file manually. The commented files may not be functional due to the comments.
