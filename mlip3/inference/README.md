# MLIP-3 Inference Demo

## Purpose

This demo shows how to run molecular dynamics simulations in LAMMPS using a trained MLIP-3 MTP. It demonstrates how to set up and execute an inference run with MLIP-3, using a sample quartz structure.

## Files

- `in.lmp`: LAMMPS input script that sets up the simulation, loads the MLIP-3 potential, and runs dynamics.
- `run.sh`: Bash script to execute the simulation using MPI.
- `log.lammps`: Output log file generated by LAMMPS after running the simulation.

## Instructions

1. **Review the input script**  
   Open `in.lmp` to see how the simulation is configured and how the MLIP-3 potential is loaded.

2. **Run the simulation**  
    Execute the following command in the terminal:
   ```sh
   sh run.sh
   ```
3. **Check results**
   Note the simulation rate from `log.lammps`.
