# New MTP GPU Inference Demo

## Purpose

This demo shows how to run a molecular dynamics simulation in LAMMPS using the new MTP implementation on GPU with the thread parallel method. It demonstrates how to use a trained potential for inference on a quartz structure.

## Files

- `in.lmp`: LAMMPS input script that sets up the simulation and loads the MTP potential.
- `run.sh`: Bash script to execute the simulation using MPI.
- `log.lammps`: Output log file generated by LAMMPS after running the simulation.

## Instructions

1. **Review the input script**  
   Open `in.lmp` to see how the simulation is configured and how the MTP potential is loaded.

2. **Run the simulation**  
   Execute the following command in the terminal:
   ```sh
   sh run.sh
   ```
3. Check results.
   Note the simulation rate from `log.lammps`.
