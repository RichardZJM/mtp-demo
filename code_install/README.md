# MTP softwares: Installation Guide

## Purpose

This guide explains how to install all necessary software for running demo. This includes installing MLIP-3, the new MTP implementation with GPU support, and MTP pruning.

## Files

- `download.sh`: Downloads all required repositories.
- `install_mlip3.sh`: Installs MLIP-3 and its LAMMPS interface.
- `install_newmtp.sh`: Installs the new LAMMPS build with optional GPU support.
- `install_pruning.sh`: Installs the pruning software and sets up the Python environment.
- `mlip3/active_learning/README.md`: Instructions for running the demo.
- Other directories and files as downloaded by the scripts.

## Installation Instructions

**Before running each step, review the corresponding script to understand its actions and adjust any settings for your system.**

1. **Download All Required Code**

   - Review `download.sh` for repository URLs and directory structure.
   - Run:
     ```sh
     sh download.sh
     ```

2. **Install MLIP-3 and LAMMPS Interface**

   - Review `install_mlip3.sh` for build options and paths.
   - Run:
     ```sh
     sh install_mlip3.sh
     ```

3. **Install New LAMMPS Build (CPU or GPU)**

   - Review `install_newmtp.sh` and set `MAKE_GPU=false` or `MAKE_GPU=true` as needed.
   - Run:
     ```sh
     sh install_newmtp.sh
     ```

4. **Install Pruning Software and Python Environment**
   - Review `install_pruning.sh` for Python environment setup and package installation.
   - Run:
     ```sh
     sh install_pruning.sh
     ```

## Notes

- You may need to adjust the number of cores (`NCORES`) in the scripts for faster compilation.
- For GPU builds, ensure CUDA (or AMD equivalent) modules are loaded on your system.
- Refer to the individual scripts for further customization and troubleshooting tips.
